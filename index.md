#Ecommerce
Ecommerce is always a great project to practice. As it is complex by nature, a lot about routing and middleware can be learned. 

## NODE AND EXPRESS

I am really exciting about using Nodejs in development, since there's very little that Javascript can't do. After the completion of this repository, I will move it into a project where there will be extension of desktop apps if possible. 

The end product will be an ecommerce site, but this knowledge can be applied in any other websites since ecommerce is complex by nature.

I am looking to implement a good CMS either via npm or some useful ones already available. May be there is a solution to this like in the django framework, since the backend is out of the box available. In express we have to manage everything so let's see. May be barebone html and css is enough as well.

###Starting a nodejs server
With express this comes easy. yarn init and some few lines of code and the server is ready to go. The challenge is to build on the top of the entry nodejs file. 

###using express
After installing express, 


`
yarn init;
yarn add express body-parser;
yard add ejs nodemon;
`

### Database
Implemention Mysql is useful I think. Currently I am using local files to create and manipulate small data. The website also contains separate views for:

1. admin
2. visitors

**Admins** are both __superusers__ and __users__ whereas all other visitors are normal users or **visitors**
